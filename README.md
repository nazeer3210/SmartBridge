# Visa Approval Prediction

This project is to predict the case status of an application submitted by the employer to hire non-immigrant workers under the H-1B visa program. Employer can hire non-immigrant workers only after their LCA petition is approved. The approved LCA petition is then submitted as part of the Petition for a Non-immigrant Worker application for work authorizations for H-1B visa status.
